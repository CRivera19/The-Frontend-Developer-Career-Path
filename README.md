# The-Frontend-Developer-Career-Path
** The Frontend Developer Career Path from Scrimba **

## This repo is my notes and journey with Scrimba's Frontend Dev Career Path. 

### I intend to complete this path with projects for my portfolio and become a web developer. I also wish to complete the bootcamp portion when completed the path for more assistance.

This career path will turn me into a hireable frontend developer, and teach me how to nail the job interview. It contains over 70 hours of top-notch tutorials, hundreds of coding challenges, and dozens of real-world projects.
